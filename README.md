# Lexical-analyser-Lab2

Statement: Use lex to perform scanning for your programming language

The scanner input will be a text file containing the source program, and will produce as output the following:

- PIF - Program Internal Form

- ST  - Symbol Table

Solution

l.l is the lexical scanner.

We apply the scanner on Lab2.txt and optain the Symbol Table and the Program Internal Form.

I have compared the Symbol Table and the PIF from the scanner in Python and the scanner in Lex, the results can be seen in SymbolTable.png, PIF1.png and PIF2.png files.
